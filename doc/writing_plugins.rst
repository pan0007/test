Writing plugins
###############

Plugins are the main part of RPG. Their purpose is to append :doc:`Spec class  <api_spec>` with tags and scripts. Whole process of creating spec file from source code in RPG app is following:

* plugins are triggered in project directory - they set some tags/scripts in Spec instance
* guessed values from Spec are auto filled in GUI forms and user can modify them
* next spec command (``%prep``, ``%build``, ``%install``, ``%files``) is executed and new directory is created
* repeat steps for new directory

Plugin is a class that is derived from ``rpg.plugin.Plugin`` and overrides at least one of following methods: ``extracted``, `patched`, ``compiled``, ``installed``, ``package_built``. Each of them takes ``(spec, current_dir, sack)`` parameters. ``spec`` is instance of :doc:`Spec class  <api_spec>`, ``sack`` is initialized sack from DNF and ``current_dir`` is pathlib.Path instance where are project files of future RPM package located. ``current_dir`` is different in each phase.

   "patched", "after application of patches on source files", :meth:`patched source analysis <__init__.Base.run_patched_source_analysis>`
   "compiled", "after execution of ``%build`` script (e.g. calling ``make``)", :meth:`compiled source analysis <__init__.Base.run_compiled_source_analysis>`
   "installed", "directory containing files after ``make install``", :meth:`installed source analysis <__init__.Base.run_installed_source_analysis>`

Inside plugin can be helper methods that should not be named as any of the phase. It should follow conventions as any private Python method (e.g. ``_helper_method``).
